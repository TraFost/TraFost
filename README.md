## About Me

I‚Äôm a Full Stack Developer with over 2 years of experience delivering web and mobile applications. Skilled in React, Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, and cloud platforms, I have built production-ready systems that include secure APIs, real-time chat, and optimized workflows.

I take full ownership of projects, from database schema design and backend architecture to frontend polish and user experience. My focus is on clean architecture, performance, and reliability, with recent work involving system flows, background job queues, and integrations.

## Personal Drive (ÂéüÂãïÂäõ)

I'm a big fan of Hajime no Ippo, the idea of ‚Äútaking the first step‚Äù (‰∏ÄÊ≠©) is how I keep moving forward.
I come from a background where I had to learn everything the hard way. Now I show up every day with focus, hunger, and heart.
